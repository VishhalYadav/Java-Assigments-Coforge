public class Features {

// 1. **Simple and Easy to Learn**
// Java was designed to be straightforward and easy to learn, especially for programmers familiar with C or C++. It avoids complex features such as pointers and operator overloading.

// 2. **Object-Oriented**
// Java is inherently object-oriented, with support for principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

// Object-oriented programming (OOP) promotes modular design, code reuse, and easier maintenance. It allows developers to model real-world entities as objects, improving code organization and scalability.

// 3. **Platform-Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)**
// Java programs are compiled into platform-neutral bytecode, which can be executed on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.


// 4. **Secure**
// Java provides built-in security mechanisms such as bytecode verification during runtime, runtime access controls, and a robust security manager.


// 5. **Robust and Reliable**
// Java emphasizes strong memory management through automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and type safety (compile-time checking).


// 6. **Multi-threaded**
// Java supports concurrent programming with built-in features for creating and managing threads.

// Multi-threading enables Java applications to perform tasks concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness. It's essential for applications that need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, like servers and GUI-based applications.

// 7. **High Performance**
// Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler optimizes bytecode into native machine code at runtime, enhancing performance.

//  JIT compilation minimizes startup time and improves overall execution speed. Combined with efficient memory management, Java achieves competitive performance comparable to lower-level languages like C++.

// 8. **Distributed**
// Java supports distributed computing with extensive libraries for network communication (e.g., RMI, JDBC).

//  This feature facilitates the development of distributed applications where components can communicate seamlessly over a network. Java's networking capabilities are integral to building scalable and interconnected systems.

// 9. **Dynamic**
// Java supports dynamic loading of classes and libraries, allowing programs to dynamically extend their functionality during runtime.
